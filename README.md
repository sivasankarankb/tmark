# tmark
Markdown renderer with templates


## Why this Project Exists

This was my situation:
- Create a website with as much source as possible in Markdown.
- Style the site with Tailwind CSS.
- Change the styling of all (or a set of) pages by editing one template.
- Make sure the tool was trustable and reliable.

I could not find anything that matched this. Maybe I didn't look deep enough.
